			We are students of VIT University Chennai Campus and this is our attempt at making a functional payment portal for VIT
		</div>
		<div class="content subtitle">
			This is a web based application. In this, we will be maintaining the complete details of the college through online i.e. maintaining the student data, administration data, hostel data and also the generating the reports.
			Student data like hostel registration and fee maintenance. Reports of student registration, fee reports, examination reports, library reports etc. University has a large number of students who pay all the university fees through cash deposits, bank drafts to the universityâ€™s accounts in specific bank branches. These methods of paying fees have not been efficient enough especially during periods of admissions and transfer of program when most of the students are paying fees to meet the requirements for administration. The process of paying fees is characterized by long queues, too much waiting by students and congestion at banks where payments are made. It was upon such background that we thought of making this project to develop of an alternative system that enables online fees payment by students.
